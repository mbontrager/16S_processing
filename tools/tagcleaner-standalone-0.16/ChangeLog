-- Version history --

Certain updates only apply to the web version, but they should be obvious to
figure out since they are likely modification of the interface.

tagcleaner-standalone-0.16:
Support tag prediction in mixed-case sequences.

tagcleaner-standalone-0.15:
Fix warnings during tag prediction.

tagcleaner-standalone-0.14:
Fixed issue with line width parameter not being set. Fix warnings with
defined statements.

tagcleaner-standalone-0.13:
Fixed issue that generated warnings when the trimmed sequence is zero-length.
Modified filename check to prevent endless loop. Other minor fixes.

tagcleaner-web-0.12 / tagcleaner-standalone-0.12:
Added matrix "exact" to allow trimming of ambiguous bases without considering
the ambiguity code.

tagcleaner-web-0.11.1 / tagcleaner-standalone-0.11.1:
Corrected typo in regex (missing \ before s*).

tagcleaner-web-0.11 / tagcleaner-standalone-0.11:
Added support for ambiguous characters in the input sequences (thanks to Dave
Messina from Stockholm for the suggestion). Character matching can be set based
on three predefined matrices (new option -matrix). Non-IUPAC characters for
nucleic acids are mismatched by default.

Fixed issue in tag detection for unknown shifts. Added File::Path for legacy
support.

tagcleaner-web-0.9 / tagcleaner-standalone-0.9:
First release of standalone version. Web version now uses standalone version in
backend. Improved tag detection. New features for the splitting of concatenated
fragments and tag repeats. Filter options are now limited as filtering should be
performed using PRINSEQ tool after trimming. Web version now allows FASTQ input
and output and the processing of larger input files.

tagcleaner-web-0.8:
Fixed issue with uninitialized qual variable causing silent errors. Fixed issue
with "good"/"bad" in output selection. Fixed issue with undefined header line.

tagcleaner-web-0.7:
Fixed bug in tag detection when no shifts can be found. Fixed issue in parsing
FASTQ files with no information in '+' header line.

tagcleaner-web-0.6:
Added new function to tag sequence detection interface: "Use as 3'-end". Added
Javascript function to check for tag sequence length to restrict tag sequences
to max 64 bp.

tagcleaner-web-0.5:
Fixed "substr outside of string" during detection of tag sequence repeats.

tagcleaner-web-0.4:
Fixed cross browser issues. Added new functions to tag sequence detection
("Reset to prediction" and "Clear all").
